## MongoDB

For this project we used MongoDB as our database. We connected our API to the database in order to automatially generate and render the questions for the quizzes.

## GraphQL

A graphQL server was created in order to run the server for the applications. We made use of the queries and mutatations in order to get the application to run smoothly without bugs.

We had 3 main queries for the application, which were:

- Get Quiz
- Get Quizes
- Get my quiz

The mutations we used:

- login
- sign up
- create quiz
- delete quiz
